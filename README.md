# Web-SPC-Player
Render (and, eventually, play) spc chiptune files in the browser. Uses [snes_spc](https://github.com/blarggs-audio-libraries/snes_spc).

Thank you to MatthewCallis, the creator of [spc.js](https://github.com/MatthewCallis/spc.js), whose repository helped me figure out how to make spc playback on the web more performant (by using the snes_spc library instead of game_music_emu).
